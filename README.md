Begginers practice in Tableau.
Thanks Alex the analyst!!

In this project we search in the Airbnb Data set from 2016 in Portland USA. The analysis its done for a client that want to buy a house or an apartment in portland 
to rent in the Airbnb business. The idea is to show with data were in portland are the most rented hoods, wich type of apartment or house is looking the airbnb users, and 
if there is an business oportunity in Portland.
